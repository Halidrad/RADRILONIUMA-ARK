# WORKFLOW SNAPSHOT (STATE)

## Identity
repo: RADRILONIUMA
branch: master
timestamp_utc: 2026-06-07T04:04:00Z

## Current pointer
phase: PHASE_R_WAVE_1_OWNER_EXECUTION_DONE
protocol_scale: +1
protocol_semantic_en: positive
goal:
- Transition and verify the boot, autostart, and lifesupport configuration from gemini to agy.
- Keep Phase A/B global closure markers in `PENDING` until full readiness.
- Keep rollout through existing owners only (no-new-agents).
- Keep delegation strictly within existing nodes (anti-sprawl).
constraints:
- one task per cycle (Intent -> Action -> Verify -> Report -> STOP)
- no new agents or repositories
- no commit without explicit Architect confirmation
- operate only in /home/architit/work/RADRILONIUMA

## Crosswalk (Canonical)
- MASTER_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN_V1.md => Task Spec invariants (derivation_only, fail-fast, patch_sha256)
- LOCAL_INTEGRATION_DELEGATION_PLAN_V1.md => owner/reuse map on existing nodes only
- TASK_SPEC_PACK_PHASE_A_V1.md => executable Phase A task IDs and verify markers

## Next executable package
- wave_id: PHASE_R_WAVE_1
- owner_node: RADRILONIUMA (Bridge governance kickoff)
- task_set:
  - phaseR_R0_wave_kickoff_and_pointer_sync (done)
  - phaseR_R1_research_gate_benchmark_plan (done)
  - phaseR_R2_owner_research_gate_execution (done: 6/6)
- integration_points:
  - keep Phase A/B evidence chains as `PENDING` snapshots (`6/39`)
  - preserve benchmark comparability (`transport/vector/trigger`) across owners

## NEW_CHAT_INIT_MESSAGE
ssn rstrt
Read WORKFLOW_SNAPSHOT_STATE.md and SYSTEM_STATE.md, run read-only context sync (pwd, git status -sb, git log -n 12 --oneline), then resume from MASTER_ALIGNMENT_BRIDGE_DIRECTIVE_GATE with PHASE_A_WAVE_1_TASKSPEC_CORE as the next executable package.
