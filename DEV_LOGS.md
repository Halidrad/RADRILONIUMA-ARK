## [2026-03-05] — BRIDGE PHASE START READINESS GATE

### [04:40] — READINESS INTENT
- Objective: complete Bridge Readiness Gate before starting the next phase.
- Scope constrained to `/home/architit/work/RADRILONIUMA`.
- Atomic cycle policy enforced: Intent -> Action -> Verify -> Report -> STOP.

### [04:41] — ROLE CONSISTENCY CHECK (BRIDGE/CASTLE)
- Canonical grep evidence collected for: Bridge, CASTLE, RADRILONIUMA-PROJECT, Captain.
- Role mapping confirmed:
  - RADRILONIUMA = Captain Bridge.
  - RADRILONIUMA-PROJECT = CASTLE (Repository of Results + DevKit contract surface).
- Prior normalization references acknowledged: d8937e1 (role normalization), 0114155 (bridge sync).

### [04:42] — STATE READINESS UPDATE
- Updated `SYSTEM_STATE.md` to reflect READY/PASS for phase-start gate.
- Updated `WORKFLOW_SNAPSHOT_STATE.md` with current readiness pointer and constraints.

### [04:43] — EVIDENCE REPORT PREP
- Prepared governance evidence artifact: `gov/report/BRIDGE_PHASE_START_READINESS_2026-03-05.md`.
- Final gate includes governance test, `git status -sb`, and `git diff --stat`.

## [2026-03-05] — MASTER ALIGNMENT BRIDGE DIRECTIVE (PHASE A NEXT WAVE)

### [04:46] — INTENT
- Build Bridge Execution Directive from canonical source chain:
  - MASTER_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN_V1.md
  - LOCAL_INTEGRATION_DELEGATION_PLAN_V1.md
  - TASK_SPEC_PACK_PHASE_A_V1.md
- Keep execution planning inside existing nodes only (Anti-Sprawl Gate).

### [04:47] — CROSSWALK RESULT
- MASTER -> fixes Task Spec invariants: derivation_only, fail-fast, patch_sha256 pinning.
- LOCAL -> fixes delegation map and no-new-agents policy.
- TASK_SPEC -> provides Phase A executable task IDs, dependencies, and verify commands.

### [04:48] — NEXT EXECUTABLE PACKAGE (PHASE_A_WAVE_1_TASKSPEC_CORE)
- Owner node: RADRILONIUMA-PROJECT (CASTLE).
- Task set selected for immediate start:
  - phaseA_t001_task_spec_contract_v1_1
  - phaseA_t002_task_spec_validator_contract
  - phaseA_t013_master_owner_map_evidence
- Integration points (existing nodes only):
  - Archivator_Agent (integrity-chain downstream dependencies).
  - LAM_Test_Agent (regression gate coverage).

### [04:49] — STOP/GO CRITERIA FIXED
- GO if: preconditions satisfied, patch_sha256 pins match, verifies pass, no conflict_detected.
- STOP if: hash mismatch, missing preconditions, 3-way apply conflict, regression failure.
- Evidence artifact: gov/report/MASTER_ALIGNMENT_BRIDGE_DIRECTIVE_2026-03-05.md.

## [2026-03-05] — PHASE A LOCAL EXECUTION (RADRILONIUMA)

### [05:10] — A0 ARCHITECTURE SCAN + INTEGRATION MAP
- Generated local scan and delegation map without creating entities:
  - `gov/report/PHASE_A_A0_ARCHITECTURE_SCAN_AND_INTEGRATION_MAP_2026-03-05.md`
- Scope held to `/home/architit/work/RADRILONIUMA`.

### [05:12] — A1 TASK SPEC CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT
- Added local Task Spec v1.1 template mirror:
  - `devkit/task_spec_template.yaml`
- Added fail-fast validator and contract:
  - `scripts/task_spec_validator.py`
  - `contract/TASK_SPEC_VALIDATOR_CONTRACT_V1_1.md`
- Enforced markers:
  - `constraints.derivation_only = true`
  - `artifacts.patch_sha256` pinned to 64-lower-hex
  - explicit `preconditions`
  - limits: `timeout_ms`, `max_output_tokens`

### [05:14] — A2 GOVERNANCE CHECK WIRING
- Added governance tests:
  - `tests/test_task_spec_governance.py`
- Updated `scripts/test_entrypoint.sh --governance`:
  - runs validator first, then `pytest -q tests -k governance`.

### [05:15] — A3 CLOSURE PREP
- Closure evidence pending command run and hash capture.

### [05:18] — A3 CLOSURE DONE
- Closure report written:
  - `chronolog/PHASE_A_CLOSURE_REPORT_2026-03-05.md`
- Protocol finalized with status:
  - `DONE` (A0/A1/A2/A3 completed, verification commands passed).

### [05:25] — PHASE A COMPLIANCE DRIFT REMEDIATION
- Task Spec upgraded to v1.1 marker: `spec_version: "1.1"`.
- Validator migrated from regex-only matching to strict YAML parsing (`yaml.safe_load`).
- Canonical contract renamed to v1.1:
  - `contract/TASK_SPEC_VALIDATOR_CONTRACT_V1_1.md`
  - v1 alias retained as superseded pointer (`TASK_SPEC_VALIDATOR_CONTRACT_V1.md`) to avoid deletion.
- Governance wiring reaffirmed:
  - `scripts/test_entrypoint.sh --governance` calls validator with `--fail-fast`.

## [2026-03-05] — PHASE B PATCH RUNTIME KICKOFF (LOCAL)

### [06:05] — B1 PATCH RUNTIME GUARDRAILS
- Upgraded `devkit/patch.sh` to Phase B behavior:
  - clean-tree precondition (`PATCH_TREE_NOT_CLEAN`);
  - mandatory `--sha256` integrity pin check;
  - mandatory `--task-id` for audit trace chain;
  - mandatory `--spec-file` for non-empty `spec_hash`;
  - conflict-safe precheck via `git apply --check --3way`;
  - machine-readable `status=<...>` + `error_code=<...>`;
  - explicit conflict status `status=conflict_detected`.

### [06:07] — B2 CONTRACT + TEST WIRING
- Added Phase B runtime contract:
  - `contract/PATCH_RUNTIME_CONTRACT_V1.md`
- Added governance tests for patch runtime:
  - `tests/test_patch_runtime_governance.py`

## [2026-03-05] — PHASE B STATUS CORRECTION

### [06:50] — LOCAL VS GLOBAL CLARIFICATION
- Clarified scope boundary for Phase B:
  - `RADRILONIUMA` Phase B closure is `LOCAL_DONE`.
  - ecosystem-wide Phase B closure remains `GLOBAL_PENDING`.
- Added owner-chain plan artifact:
  - `gov/report/PHASE_B_OWNER_CHAIN_PLAN_2026-03-05.md`
- Updated system/workflow pointers to execute owner-chain global closure before any Phase C kickoff.

## [2026-03-05] — PHASE B OWNER-CHAIN EVIDENCE SYNC

### [11:42] — ARCHIVATOR OWNER CLOSURE MIRROR

  - owner commit: `b5efe5c5509e4d88206f88a071954e9dda1c9899`
- Preserved protocol gate:
  - Phase B global owner-chain remains `PENDING` until remaining owners are verified.

- `GLOBAL_PENDING` retained intentionally; progress marker set to `5/39`.

### [13:36] — PHASE A READY SUBSET TRACKING (6/39)
- Corrected Phase A owner-chain status to mirror the same governance rule:
  - only confirmed ready repositories are counted;
  - no premature global closure marker.
- Updated `gov/report/PHASE_A_OWNER_CHAIN_VERIFICATION_2026-03-05.md` to:
  - `status=IN_PROGRESS`
  - `progress=6/39 repositories ready`
  - explicit `PENDING` global status until full owner-chain completion.

### [13:42] — PHASE B READY SUBSET TRACKING (6/39)
- Added `System-` owner closure mirror to Phase B verification.
- Updated Phase B progress marker from `5/39` to `6/39`.
- `GLOBAL_PENDING` preserved by protocol (wave-based rollout, not global closure).

### [13:55] — PHASE C WAVE KICKOFF
- Accepted transition to Phase C in wave mode (not global closure mode).
- Added kickoff artifact:

  - `WORKFLOW_SNAPSHOT_STATE.md` -> `phase=PHASE_C_WAVE_KICKOFF`
  - `TASK_MAP.md` -> `phaseC_C0` complete, `phaseC_C1` in progress
- Preserved global snapshots:
  - Phase A: `PENDING (6/39)`
  - Phase B: `PENDING (6/39)`

## [2026-06-04] — AELARIA SYSTEM PATCH (BRIDGE DIRECTIVE)

### [03:30] — PATCH EXECUTION (RADR-01)
- **Bluetooth Fix:** `AutoEnable=true` enforced in `/etc/bluetooth/main.conf`. Service restarted.
- **Hardware Stack:** `openrazer-meta`, `polychromatic`, and `input-remapper` installed via PPAs.
- **Group Membership:** User added to `plugdev` group.
- **Service Status:** `input-remapper-daemon` ACTIVE and ENABLED.
- **Graceful Shutdown:** `chrome-graceful-shutdown.service` established in user session (default.target).
- **Verification:** All components verified via `systemctl` and `grep`.
- **Note:** System reboot required for `plugdev` group changes to take full effect.
